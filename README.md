# Autonomous Agent for Hex 11 in Java

Welcome to the Autonomous Agent for Hex 11 repository! This project showcases an autonomous agent to play the Hex 11 game. The agent is built in Java and employs adapted and improved versions of Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm and the Minimax algorithm to make strategic decisions.

## Features

- **Autonomous Agent**: Capable of playing Hex 11 against other agents or human players.
- **Improved Algorithms**: Utilizes enhanced versions of Dijkstra's and Minimax algorithms for optimal decision-making.
- **Gameplay**: The agent can compete against other agents, demonstrating strategic gameplay and adaptability.
- **Java Implementation**: Developed entirely in Java for ease of use and integration.
